// Every Sass variable in Bootstrap includes the !default flag allowing you to override the variable’s default value in your own Sass without modifying Bootstrap’s source code. Copy and paste variables as needed, modify their values, and remove the !default flag. If a variable has already been assigned, then it won’t be re-assigned by the default values in Bootstrap.

// You will find the complete list of Bootstrap’s variables in scss/_variables.scss. Some variables are set to null, these variables don’t output the property unless they are overridden in your configuration.

// Variable overrides must come after our functions are imported, but before the rest of the imports.
